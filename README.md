## Prerequisites
Hop on over to [the Particle.io store](https://store.particle.io) and order any or all of their cool devices.

> While developing this plugin and the [demo app](demo/) I used a [Photon Kit](https://store.particle.io/collections/photon) and it was a joy to work with.
>
> Thanks, [Brandon Satrom](https://twitter.com/BrandonSatrom) for sending one over!

## Installation
```bash
tns plugin add nativescript-particle
```

## iOS 12+ setup
iOS 12 and up requires you to enable 'Access WiFi Information' for your App ID [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle).

Also, add this to your `App_Resources/iOS/app.entitlements` (mind the name!) file:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info</key>
<true/>
```

The [demo app](demo) has this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Demo app
If you want to just play with your Particle device without writing code yet,
follow these steps to install the demo app I've created with NativeScript Core:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-particle
cd nativescript-particle/src
npm i
npm run demo.ios # or demo.android
```

> Tip: If you get tired entering your login credentials every time you log in, set the [`PARTICLE_USERNAME` and `PARTICLE_PASSWORD` properties to reflect your own](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-particle/blob/618dea7d0a5d3c1cd9cb287e70142375547faa60/demo/app/main-view-model.ts#L7-L8).

## API
All examples below assume you have these imports and instantiated the `Particle` class:

```typescript
import { Particle, TNSParticleDevice, TNSParticleEvent } from "nativescript-particle";
const particle = new Particle();
```

### `startDeviceSetupWizard`
To help registering devices to your account (and avoid having to use the Particle CLI) you can add devices to your account right from your app! ðŸ˜Ž

```typescript
particle.startDeviceSetupWizard()
    .then(isSuccessful => console.log("Wizard success? " + isSuccessful));
```

### `login`
Communication between your app and a device is HTTP (REST) based,
so the first step is authenticating yourself with the Particle Cloud:

```typescript
particle.login(
    {
      username: "my-particle-username@mydomain.com",
      password: "my-particle-password"
    })
    .then(() => console.log("Login successful"))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Login error: ${error}`));
```

### `loginWithToken`
Alternatively, you can login with an access token.

```typescript
particle.loginWithToken("the_token");
```

### `logout`
Once done interacting with your device(s) it's best to log out as this will do a little cleanup in the plugin and underlying SDK.

There's no reason not to because it couldn't be easier:

```typescript
particle.logout();
```

### `publish`
Publish an event from your app to the Particle Device Cloud.

```typescript
particle.publish(
    "ledStatusApp123", // the event name
    "ON", // the event data (string)
    true, // isPrivate (default true)
    30 // ttl (default 60)
);
```

### `subscribe`
Subscribe to the firehose of public events, plus the private events published by devices one owns.
You really want to use a unique prefix, otherwise you'll receive a lot of data (not only from your own devices!).

```typescript
particle.subscribe(
    "ledStatusApp123",
    (event: TNSParticleEvent) => console.log(`Got a ledStatus event for App 123 from the Particle Cloud: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`));
```

### `unsubscribe`
To stop receiving published events, unsubscribe from the events. Make sure the prefix is equal to the one you previously subscribed with.

```typescript
particle.unsubscribe("ledStatusApp123");
```

### `listDevices`
Make sure you've claimed a device in your Particle account, then do this to list them in your app:

```typescript
particle.listDevices()
    .then((devices: Array<TNSParticleDevice>) => {
      if (devices.length === 0) {
        console.log("No devices have been claimed in this account.");
      } else {
        console.log("Devices fetched.. now do something neat with 'em.");
      }
    })
    .catch(error => console.log(`Error fetching devices: ${error}`));
```

The returned list of `TNSParticleDevice` objects has these properties and functions:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | `string` | The unique ID of this device. |
| name | `string` | The given name of this device. |
| status | `string` | The current status of the device, usually `normal`. |
| connected | `boolean` | Whether or not the device is currently connected.. |
| type | [`TNSParticleDeviceType`](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-particle/blob/618dea7d0a5d3c1cd9cb287e70142375547faa60/src/particle.common.ts#L1-L10) | One of `Unknown`, `Core`, `Photon`, `P1`, `Electron`, `RaspberryPi`, `DigistumpOak`, `RedBearDuo`, `Bluz`. |
| functions | `Array<string>` | The list of functions currently available on the device. You can invoke these with `callFunction` (see below). |
| variables | `Array<`[`TNSParticleDeviceVariable`](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-particle/blob/618dea7d0a5d3c1cd9cb287e70142375547faa60/src/particle.common.ts#L38-L41)`>` | The list of variables currently available on the device. You can get their values with `getVariable` (see below). |

#### `<device>.rename`
You can change the device name right from your app! ðŸ’ª

```typescript
const myDevice: TNSParticleDevice = null; // you got this from 'listDevices'

myDevice.rename("rocket_bubble")
    .then(() => console.log("Device renamed"))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Error renaming the device: ${error}`));
```

#### `<device>.callFunction`
You can invoke any of the `functions` you discovered on the device.

As an example let's assume you've flashed [this code tutorial](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/#read-your-photoresistor-function-and-variable) to your device,
so there's a `led` function which takes 1 argument: the value must be either `"on"`, or `"off"`:

```typescript
const myDevice: TNSParticleDevice = null; // you got this from 'listDevices'

myDevice.callFunction("led", "on")
    .then(result => console.log(`Result: ${result}`))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Error in callFunction: ${error}`));
```

What if you have a function which takes multiple arguments? Let's assume you're using the [tinker app](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/#tinker) and want to set `"D7"` to `"HIGH"` via the `"digitalWrite"` function:

```typescript
myDevice.callFunction("digitalWrite", "D7", "HIGH")
    .then(result => console.log(`Result: ${result}`))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Error in callFunction: ${error}`));
```

#### `<device>.getVariable`
Getting a variable is quite similar to `callFunction`.

Let's say you have a variable named `"analogvalue"`, then this will give you the current state of that variable:

```typescript
const myDevice: TNSParticleDevice = null; // you got this from 'listDevices'

myDevice.getVariable("analogvalue")
    .then(result => console.log(`Result: ${result}`))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Error in getVariable: ${error}`));
```

#### `<device>.subscribe`
You can get notified in your app in case an app on one of your devices publishes an event.

To suppress noise you can filter those events by supplying a prefix, in this case `my-prefix-`, so events like `my-prefix-temp` or `my-prefix-sensorOn` are caught:

```typescript
const myDevice: TNSParticleDevice = null; // you got this from 'listDevices'

myDevice.subscribe(
    "my-prefix-",
    (event: TNSParticleEvent) => console.log(`device event: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`));
```

#### `<device>.unsubscribe`
To stop receiving published events from your devices, unsubscribe from the events. Make sure the prefix is equal to the one you previously subscribed with.

```typescript
myDevice.unsubscribe("my-prefix-");
```

#### `<device>.unclaim`
Removes this device from your account.

```typescript
myDevice.unclaim();
```
